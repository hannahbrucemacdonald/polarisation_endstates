### Input files
Input files for the simulation were adapted from https://github.com/linfranksong/Input_TI, and can be found here: https://github.com/openmm/openmmforcefields/tree/master/openmmforcefields/data/perses_jacs_systems

### Forcefields
Using openmm-forcefields:
    - amber/protein.ff14SB.xml 
    - amber/tip3p_standard.xml 
    - amber/tip3p_HFE_multivalent.xml 

Several different small molecule forcefields have been used, and results are in folders named accordingly.
